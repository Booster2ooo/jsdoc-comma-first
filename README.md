# JSDoc-Comma-First

## Description
jsdoc-comma-first is a plugin for [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) that enable comma first coding style. In comma first style, when declaring variables or properties, instead of putting the commas at the end of the line, we'll put it at the beginning of the next one.
This seems to be an [issue](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/issues/446) in JSDoc so I decided to provide this plugin.

## How to
Just grab the plugin and [configure JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-configuring-jsdoc.html#plugins) accordingly.
